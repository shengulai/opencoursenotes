**Deterministic Game**: Â the outcome of each action is fully predictable and determined
**Stochastic Game**: the outcome of an action depends on a probabilistic process

**Zero-sum Game**: agents has opposite utility: one max, the other min
**General-sum Game**: independent utilities

- ==deterministic== and ==zero-sum== games
**Alpha-beta Pruning**
- store an $\alpha$ value which is the max from the min node
- store an $\beta$ value which is the min from the max node
- cut the branch if $\beta < \alpha$
**Depth-limited Search**
- replace terminal value with a evaluation function
**Expectimax Search**
- chance node instead of the min node in the figure above: expectation of the children
- need to know all children values to compute the $\mathbb{E}$
